# Old Guns Mod (Forge)

### A mod that supplies a collection of antique firearms. Heavily inspired by Ye Olde Minegunner mod from the days of Minecraft Beta v1.2.

See below for separate descriptions for recent versions. Note that newer versions may not be feature-equivalent.

### v3.0.0

- Rewrite for minecraft 1.18.1.
- Only includes flintlock weapons, no breechloading variants.
- No cannons.
- Exotic weapons only spawn in chests. Find them and repair them!
- Patchouli book planned, but not implemented.

### v2.0.5

- For Minecraft 1.12.2.
- No needlefire weapons.



## Overview

#### Old Guns adds a colletion of mid-15th century to early 19th century black powder arms right to the front door of your dirt house:

- A teired system of Matchlock, Wheellock, Flintlock, Caplock, and Needlefire firearms.

- Traditional weapons such as Derringers, Pistols, Carbines, Muskets, Blunderbusses.

- More unconventional weapons like Duckfoot Pistols, Musketoons, Nock Guns, and other variants.


#### The firearms are set up weight categories as well as the aforementioned teirs of mechanism tech:

- Light firearms like pistols can be dual-wielded, drawn fast, cheap, but lack the stopping power of larger pieces.

- Carbines and other mid-sized guns provide a good balance of draw time, cost, and power, but cannot be dual-wielded.

- Larger firearms are devastating, but have a long draw time and high cost. Some huge firearms might slow you down when moving.


#### Traditional firearms are reloaded from the crafting menu, but can be upgraded to help with slow reloads.

- Multishot weapons allow you to spend time upfront reloading for more time shooting.

- Some multishot weapons like the Duckfoot pistol and Nock Gun fire _all_ their bullets at once... but still require reloading single rounds at a time.

- Breechloading weapons allow a crossbow-esqe reload, and will consume ammo and powder straight from the players inventory.


#### The mechanism a firearm uses determines its resileincy to the elements.

- Matchlock weapons will not function in rain or water at all.

- Wheellock weapons will have a difficult time firing in rain, and will not work while in water.

- Flintlock weapons will have less trouble firing in the rain, but still will not work in water.

- Caplock weapons will have no trouble firing in the rain, and can somewhat work while in water.

- Needlefire weapons will fire in all conditions.


#### Firearms need to be taken care of! You don't want to lose a finger.

- All weapons have a condition, which is based on their durability.

- Weapons in fair condition or lower will have a chance to misfire.

- Weapons in poor condition or lower will have a chance to explode in your hand.

- Repair kits are craftable, and can be combined with a firearm in your crafting menu to repair them by 25%.


#### Exotic weapons are powerful, but must be found in dungeons.

- Exotic weapons like the Duckfoot pistol and Nock Gun cannot be crafted.

- Exotic weapons are found in dungeon chests, along with various types of ammunition.

- Config options exist that can enable exotic recipes and stop them from spawning in dungeon loot.
