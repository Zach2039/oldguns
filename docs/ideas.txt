Mod Ideas:
	- Old Guns
		- Gun racks and/or display cases
		- Bayonets
			- Only on medium and large firearms.
			- Give a reach boost on long muskets.
			- Need tiered blades, similar to Balkons weapon mod.
		- Blueprint system (?)
			- Exotic firearms require a blueprint found via loot to craft


	- Addons
		- Give NPCs guns (?)
			- Skeletal militia or minutemen would be slick, but maybe as an addon.
